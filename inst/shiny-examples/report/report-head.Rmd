## Introduction

This is the start of my report.

All of the models featured have a model equation of
$$y = `r sprintf("%.2fx%+.2f", params$a, params$intercept)`$$
and each model has `r params$n` randomly generated observations.


```{r numberOfModels, echo=FALSE}
J <- length(params$dataset)
```

## Individual models

We have created `r J` model`r if (J > 1) {"s"}`.

```{r runall, include=FALSE}
out <- NULL
for (i in names(params$dataset)) {
  out <- append(out, knitr::knit_child('report-body.Rmd'))
}
```

`r paste(out, collapse = '\n')`

## Concluding remarks

This is the end of my document. I hope you enjoyed it.
