### Model `r i`

```{r, include=FALSE}
# For convenience, we'll extract the values from the params list for this
# section of the report.
d <- params$dataset()[[i]]
```

Here are some summary statistics from this dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
# Note that we can only use packages that are installed on the host system.
knitr::kable(summary(d))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x")
```
