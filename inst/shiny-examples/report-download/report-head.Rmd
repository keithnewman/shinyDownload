## Introduction

This is the start of my report.

We start with the same plot that you saw in the demonstration app:

```{r originalPlot, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
print(params[["original"]]$plot)
```

```{r numberOfAdditionalModels, echo=FALSE}
J <- length(params) - 1
```

We have created `r J` additional model(s).

```{r runall, include=FALSE}
out <- NULL
for (i in names(params)[-1]) {
  out <- append(out, knitr::knit_child('report-body.Rmd'))
}
```

`r paste(out, collapse = '\n')`
